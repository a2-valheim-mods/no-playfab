# No PlayFab

Removes PlayFab code.

**READ THIS PAGE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## What?

This mode removes any ability to play multiplatform games.

It patches `FejdStartup`,`MultiBackendMatchmaking`,`PlayFabAuthWithGameCenter`,`PlayFabManager`,`PlayFabMatchmaking`,`ZPlayFabLobbySearch`,`ZPlayFabMatchmaking` and `ZSteamMatchmaking` to make play fab unusable and filter out any servers from search that have play fab enabled.

**THIS MOD WORKS ONLY ON CLIENT, DOES NOT WORK ON DEDICATED SERVERS**

## Why?

I have no idea.

**You probably should NOT use this.**

I use this because I play only on PC, do not play with anyone on console and have poor connection.

## Does it work?

It doesn't crash my game.

I have no idea if this will improve anything for you.

I did not test it much.
